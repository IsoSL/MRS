          hey there are you a fan of Manuel manga ever wondered how those awesome recap videos on YouTube are made sure you could just throw an entire chapter into some AI translator and slap on a robotic voice over but let's be honest you deserve better than that that's why today I'm walking you through how to make a highquality recap video step by step now I'm not claiming to be a pro here in fact I'm still learning myself so if you spot any mistakes or know better ways to do things please share them in the comments I'd love to hear
          
          your thoughts all right let's Dive [Music] In Step One writing the script for many of us it feels like a total drag but trust me it's the foundation of everything without a solid script you're just winging it so before you even think about recording or editing you need a clear plan Q an example let's look at this panel from a random Mana the goal is simple write down everything you see forget structure forget grammar and definitely don't worry about making it perfect just get it all down for instance it's in the middle of the night
          
          the moon Shone brightly there's an eerie silence but you can still hear a group of footsteps marching Thunder Rolls across the sky a mighty being floats in the air known only as the Heavenly demon see the sentences are rough some grammar is questionable and it's not exactly Shakespeare that's okay your first draft doesn't have to be perfect it just has to exist once you're done head over to chat GPT paste your text in chunks of 200 400 words and ask it to one fix grammatical errors two improve the flow with smooth
          
          transitions three rewrite it in reported speech in third person here's the cool part this method turns even a messy draft into something polished enough for AI voiceovers and trust me it works wonders all right now that we've tackled the script let's move on to the fun part step two finding your voice do you think you got a good mic great a decent one in the 300 500 euro range gives you amazing quality but let's be real not everyone can drop that kind of cash and even if you have one like me you might not love
          
          your voice so here's the game changer AI voiceovers skip those robotic text to speech voices and head straight to 11 Labs it's one of the best out there use their free trial to test voices and find one that fits your Vibe enthusiastic relaxed or even a mix of both let's move on to step three collecting panels here's where the fun or the chaos begins open up your source and EST tart taking screenshots of each panel yep it's super tedious and timec consuming what I advise is when you are creating your
          
          script and take screenshots alongside but remember to save the panels in order and separate folders trust me on this one you can generally skip the unimportant scenes but make sure that the scenes you use are aligned with your audio so now we have the main components ready to be used step four editing here's where the magic happens or where your soul dies a little if you're a Mac User grab Final Cut Pro it's free for fre months for Windows users hit up Da Vinci resolve it's free and super powerful all right let's dive into
          
          editing I've already got my audio ready and the panel's prepared so now I'm going to show you how to put everything together using this random manir as an example ex Le first I'll sync the panels to match the audio listen closely to the narration and think about which panel works best for each part for example here my voice over is describing a dramatic moment so I'll line up this intense closeup of the character next I'll crop and resize the panels let's take this one as an example see how there's a lot going on in the frame I'll
          
          zoom in to focus on the character's expression it's the most impactful part for this wider shot I'll pan slowly across the action to create a sense of movement cropping is all about highlighting what matters while avoiding too much empty space now timing watch as I keep each panel on screen for about 3 to 4 seconds this keeps the pacing brisk and ensures viewers stay engaged if the panel has text I might leave it on a bit longer so people have time to read but I'll avoid letting any single image
          
          linger too long this approach also helps reduce the risk of copyright strikes short screen times make it harder for automated systems to flag your video video finally I'll add some transitions I'm keeping it simple with Fades and cuts to keep the focus on the story for a bit of extra polish I'll use slight Zoomin or pans like this one to make the visuals feel more Dynamic without overwhelming the viewer by following these steps you can create a clean engaging recap that not only tells a story effectively but also avoids most
          
          copyright pitals now it's time to make your video truly epic add V effects like crackling electricity blazing fire or glowing effects to emphasize key moments these dramatic touches bring your panels to life and add excitement pair them with sound effects that match like Sparks Flames or whooshes and some Dynamic background music to tie it all together this is how you take your recap to the next level let's be honest editing solo can be overwhelming especially as a student just learning the ropes spending hours to create a
          
          10-minute video is tough but here's the good news it gets easier with practice every project is a step forward and the progress completely worth it want to see how far I've come click the link to check out my latest video it's not Flawless but it's a product of hard work growth and passion and I couldn't be prouder if you found this helpful don't forget to drop a like share your thoughts in the comments and hit that subscribe button for more content like this
